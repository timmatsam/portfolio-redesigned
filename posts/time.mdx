Time passes so utterly strangely sometimes.

Sometimes, I just like to experience it passing.

I sit and I wait for time to be over.

But afterwards I think to myself, “I wish I had more time”.

I always look for more ways to use time, but never seem to enact them.

In that moment of time, I feel as if I have all the time in the world.

There’s something cathartic about letting time pass, just letting it unfurl.

But afterwards, the ephemeral nature of time in a finite lifetime is realized.
