# Time
Time passes so utterly strangely sometimes. 

Sometimes, I just like to experience it passing.

I sit and I wait for time to be over. 

But afterwards I think to myself, “I wish I had more time”.

I always look for more ways to use time, but never seem to enact them. 

In that moment of time, I feel as if I have all the time in the world. 

There’s something cathartic about letting time pass, without a care in the world. 

But afterwards, the ephemeral nature of time in a finite lifetime is realized.
