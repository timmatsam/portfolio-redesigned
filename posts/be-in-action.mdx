# Be In Action
Trying to learn a skill is frustrating. I get a burst of motivation 
to learn a new skill every now and then but it is rare that I actually am able to adopt one.  I spend time develop a plan on how best to learn the skill. This eventually leads to a rabbit hole where I try to find the absolute most perfect methodology to learn something as efficiently as feasibly possible. A lot of buzz words I know, but that’s exactly how perfect I want my learning experience to be. This is phrased being in motion, a concept identified for me in Atomic Habits. When we are in motion, we attempt to allocate the best learning resources for ourselves, but to do so we initially acquire a mass amount of resources and then rank them, but to rank these resources, we find more resources, and so on and so on. It’s similar to scouring Reddit for the best book to learn Python from, but a week goes by and you realize you still haven’t actually learned any Python at all. I believe that a vital reason that prevents us from even starting to focus on a critical task is because we lack the confidence that we can accomplish it. This lack of confidence plays into part why we desire the best when the good is good enough. 

This philosophy does not just take hold when we are learning something but also in events such as choosing which restaurant to go to, what movie to watch with your friends. I was personally so consumed with trying to find the best of the best, that I realized that in doing so, I enjoyed the experience less, and also wasted a substantial amount of time in pursuing them. I reaped the greatest benefits when I took action. 

It’s ironic. We try to maximize our benefits while minimizing the amount of time it takes to achieve those same benefits. In theory, on paper, it seems lucrative. But, for the aforementioned purposes, it is not. Let’s be in action. Each person has the same amount of time - do not waste it trying to save time.
