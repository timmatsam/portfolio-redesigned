Trying to learn a skill is frustrating. I get a burst of energy every now and
then but it is rare that I am able to adopt one. I spend time to develop a plan
on how best to learn the skill, which eventually leads to a rabbit hole where I
try to find the absolutely perfect methodology to learn something as efficiently
as feasibly possible. This is phrased being in motion, a concept identified for
me in Atomic Habits. When we are in motion, we attempt to allocate the best
learning resources for ourselves, but to do so we initially acquire a mass
amount of resources and then rank them, but to rank these resources, we find
more resources, and so on and so on. It’s similar to scouring Reddit for the
best book to learn Python from, but a week goes by and you realize you still
haven’t actually learned any Python at all. I believe that a vital reason which
prevents us from even starting to focus on a critical task is because we lack
the confidence we can accomplish it. This lack of confidence plays into why we
desire the best when the good is good enough.

This philosophy does not just take hold when we are learning something but also
in events such as choosing which restaurant to go to, what movie to watch with
your friends. I was personally so consumed with trying to find the best of the
best, that I realized that in doing so, I enjoyed the experience less, and also
wasted a substantial amount of time. I reaped the greatest benefits when I took
action.

It’s ironic. We try to maximize our benefits while minimizing the amount of time
it takes to achieve those same benefits. In theory, it seems lucrative. But for
the aforementioned purposes, it is not. Be in action. Each person has the same
amount of time - don't waste it trying to save time.
