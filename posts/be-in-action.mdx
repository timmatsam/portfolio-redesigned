Trying to learn a skill is frustrating. Humans receive bursts of energy and
motivation but it is not sustainable. A considerable amount of time is spent
developing a plan on how best to learn, which eventually leads to a rabbit hole
of pursuing the perfect methodology. As we
conduct this seemingly virtuous endeavor, the best learning
resources are allocated towards it, but this leads us to initially acquire a large amount and
assign a hierarchy to them. To rank these resources, more resources are indexed and
so on and so on. Take learning a language for example: a simple search on "The
best way to learn _language of choice here_" is conducted. A couple of weeks go by
and you realize you still haven’t made any progress at all. I believe a vital
reason preventing us from initializing a critical task is due to our lack of
confidence. This lack of confidence plays into why we desire the best when the
okay is enough.

This philosophy can be applied to general life decisions as well, _e.g._
identifying a restaurant to eat at, what movie to watch with your friends, etc.
I was personally so consumed with trying to find the best that I realized I
enjoyed the experience less and also wasted a substantial amount of time. I reaped the greatest benefits when I made a modicum of genuine,
goal-oriented action.

It really is quite ironic, and tragic. Humans try to maximize their benefits
while minimizing the amount of time it takes to achieve them. In theory, it
seems lucrative but for the aforementioned purposes, it is not. Be in action.
Don’t waste time trying to save it.
